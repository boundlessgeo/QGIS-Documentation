|MOD| Using Spatial Databases in QGIS 
*******************************************************************************

In this module you will learn about how to use Spatial Databases with QGIS to 
manage, display and manipulate data in the database as well as performing
analysis by querying. We will primarily use PostgreSQL and PostGIS (which were 
covered in previous sections), but the same concepts are applicable to other 
spatial database implementations including spatialite.
